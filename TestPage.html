<h2><strong>History</strong></h2><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1d/Paul_Sandby_-_London_Cries-_A_Muffin_Man_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg/415px-Paul_Sandby_-_London_Cries-_A_Muffin_Man_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg" height="240" width="166"/>
<p><em><h4>What is a Muffin?</h4></em>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muffin">muffin</a> is a baked product of individual size. It is said that the word muffin possibly derived from the Low German “muffen” meaning small cake or from the Old French word “moufflet,” meaning soft bread. There are two forms of muffins, the flatbread, (also known as English muffins) and quickbread muffins. The flatbread muffin dates back to the 18th century and is a European derivation. The quickbread muffin  dates back to the 19th century and originated in North America. Though both forms of muffins are widely used, quickbread muffins are the focus of this page.
Muffins are very similar to cupcakes in size and cooking methods. However, there are differences in the two. Cupcakes are sweet desserts that use cake batter and are topped with sugar icing. Muffins on the other hand, can be sweet or savory. Some examples of sweet muffins are blueberry muffins and chocolate chip muffins. Examples of a savory muffin are the cornmeal and bacon muffins.
Muffins are usually a breakfast food paired with coffee or tea. Muffins are  found in coffee shops, bakeries, donut shops and groceries. Muffins are so popular nationwide they even have a day, February 20, dedicated to them.(<a href="https://foodimentary.com/tag/the-history-of-muffins/">Foodimentary: National Food Holidays, 2015</a>) .

<h2><strong>Common Ingredients in Muffins</strong></h2>
<p>Quickbread muffins are made with flour, bicarbonate of soda, butter, eggs, sugar, salt and flavorings/savories like blueberries, chocolate, and cheese. The bicarbonate of soda serves as a raising agent when mixed into the flour. After the ingredients are mixed together, the mix is then distributed into a pocketed muffin tray or into individual paper molds, and then baked in an oven. One of the most popular muffins is the blueberry muffin.

<p>The blueberry muffin is one of the most popular muffins and is the official state muffin of Minnesota(<a href="https://www.leaf.tv/articles/blueberry-muffin-facts/">Leaf:Blueberry Muffin Facts,Whiting, 2018</a>). When baking blueberry muffins, it is wise to  consider the blueberries used with certain batters as lighter batters work best with frozen or fresh berries and dried blueberries work best with thicker batters. A good rule of thumb for the blueberry-to-batter ratio is 1 lb. Of blueberries for every 2 lbs. of batter.
